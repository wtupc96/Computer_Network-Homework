\paragraph{A.}
Despite TCP being much more safe than UDP, the UDP still has many advantages:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Faster transport TCP does.
	
	\item Not having complex steps establishing links between hosts, UDP is less likely to be attacked.
	
	\item Need less bandwidth, so it can be used to design real-time applications.
	
	\item The applications using UDP don't need to maintain the connection.
\end{enumerate}
